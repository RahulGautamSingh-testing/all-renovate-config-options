This repo has json files which contain all the config options and all accepted values which can be present inside the renovate bot's repo config. Options haven't been migrated btw.

This list gets automatically updated daily, currently manually (I will automate that when I have learned cron schedulingðŸ¤¡ )

The script that updates the config is hosted on replit (I run the script from there rather than locally.) and in the script.js file.

If you are new to Renovate and a contributor to an issue that is related to config validation, this repo will be of help. Just test your changes against all these files, after putting them inside `renovate.json`.
